## Summary
Isolated mass-gap black holes are a unique type of black hole that fall within a range of masses in which it can be difficult to identify a stellar mass. In this mass-range, both neutron stars and black holes exist---these black holes being mass-gap black holes. Current scientific methods utilize statistical analysis to classify such mass-gap stellar masses as black hole, neutron star, etc., but this can be a long and time-consuming process. We propose a novel machine learning driven approach to identifying such objects within the mass-gap automatically using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) microlensing surveys. We develop synthetic data based on existing classifications and compare the classification performance of three different model architectures on the data for a binary classification task. After training a Feed Forward Neural Network, a Radial Basis Function Network, and a Deep Belief Network, we find that the best candidate for mass-gap black hole and neutron star classification is the Feed Forward Neural Network with a test-set classification accuracy of 98.6%.
